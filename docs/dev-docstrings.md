# Docstrings

## Introduction

Documenting the code is a priority, and you should develop coding pattern whcih follows those steps:

1. Think what you want to achieve.
2. Write a definition of a function or a class, and create a docstring foundation. The good start is writing a sentence what the function does.
3. Write a function body.
4. Update docstring.
5. Write tests.

You may start from unit tests if you prefer this form of programming, but a docstring should be initialized before you start writing a function body. This pattern is grounding your mind on the solution that you are going to implement. Moreover, you will quickly realize that if you cannot describe function in one sentence it should be divided into two or more blocks of code.

## General rules

We use [Numpy docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) to document our code.

As a rule of thumb, we document all public functions and classes, and we document private functions and classes if they perform complex computations.

## Examples

You should follow [Numpy docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) definitions, but we provide some examples of docstrings that we use in this project.

Treat the examples as a reference.

#### Functions

Parts:

1. (Required) `Short description`,
2. (Optional) Function `summary`,
3. (Required) `Parameters` (if any is passed into a function),
4. (Required) `Returns` (if function returns any value) or `Yields` (if function is a generator),
5. (Optional) `Receives` parameters send to generator with `.send()` method.
6. (Optional) `Other Parameters`.
7. (Required) `Raises`.

11. (Optional) `Notes` - equations and explanations.
12. (Required) `References` - if code is based on a specific publication or a work of someone else then it should be cited here.
13. (Required) `Examples` - example of usage.

##### Template

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> a_var = 1
    >>> b_var = np.arange(0, 1000)
    >>> value = do_something(a_var, b_var)
    >>> print(value)
    0

    ...
    
    return ...

```

##### Example

```python
def any_index(
    categories: ArrayLike, responses: ArrayLike, alpha=1.0, beta=1.0
) -> AbulNagaYalcinIndex:
    """
    Abul Naga & Yalcin index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    categories : array
        Ordered list of possible categories.

    responses : array
        Dataset with ordinal-scale values used for index computation.

    alpha : float, default = 1
        Parameter used for index weighting. Must be greater or equal to 1.
        See Notes to learn more about this parameter.

    beta : float, default = 1
        Parameter used for index weighting. Must be greater or equal to 1.
        See Notes to learn more about this parameter.

    Returns
    -------
    index : AbulNagaYalcinIndex

    Notes
    -----
    With ``alpha`` == ``beta`` inequality is at a minimum when everyone is in
    the same category, and at a maximum when half of the population lies in
    the lowest category and half in the highest category.
    Different calibrations of the parameters and allow the researcher to
    give different weights to inequalities above and below the median of
    the responsiveness distribution -
    for higher values of ``alpha`` (``beta``), less weight is given to
    inequalities below (above) the median.

    Parameters
    ----------
    param_a : float
        A real number.

    >>> mycls.do_something()
    0
    >>> print(mycls)

        : float
            ``param_x`` raised to the power of ``param_y``.
        """
        return self.param_x**self.param_y
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f'I"m the MyClass object and I did something!.'

```

#### Modules

**Important!**

A description of modules in **ordinal-scale-stats-py** is slightly different than the `numpy` style. We include module docstring at a top of the file that groups multiple functions and classes and has own specific logic.

Parts:

1. (Required) `Short description`,
2. (Required) `Long description`,
3. (Required) `Changelog Table`: table with the major changes,
4. (Required) `Authors`: list with authors contributing to the module,
5. (Required) `References`: list of tutorials,
6. (Required) `Bibliography`: list of publications and articles related to the module.
7. (Optional) `TODO`: list of functions that should be created or debugged with links to the Github Issues.

The role of docstring in a module is to store information about changes, contributors and algorithm sources. We do not present examples - for this we have tutorials and function / class docs.

##### Template

```python
"""
Module description is placed at the top of a file.

Here we describe module in a detail. The most important questions to answer here are:
- what problem does module solve?
- what methods does module incorporate to solve this problem?
- what kind of data flows into module?
- what is the output of module?
- why this module is important?
- relation to other modules.
