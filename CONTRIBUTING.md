# Contributing Guidelines

We are incredibly grateful that you want to contribute to the project!

The project is community-driven and has a set of rules to ensure that development runs smoothly and the users get a bug-free program. Rules are short, so please refer to those before you post an issue or write a code.
## General Rules
The main rule is: **be respectful to others**. Refer to the Code of Conduct to learn more if you need clarification on what we mean by that.
## Posting Issues and Feature Requests
Have you found a bug? Do you see a space for additional functionality in the package? Then you should go to the `Issues` section! You should be aware of a few points before you post the new issue.
### Bugs
Check if someone else has reported a bug (use `Filters` above the list of issues). There is a chance that your bug is in the `Closed` section.
Prepare (1) an error message, (2) code context where your program raised an error, (3) a description of your expectations from the given function, (4) your environment specification, (5) optional - input data, (6) optional - screenshots and code samples.
Describe a bug using information from the previous point.
### Features
Describe feature.
Give links to the bibliography and publications if a requested feature is a statistical method.
Be prepared that maintainers won't implement the new functionality because of their commitments elsewhere!
## Helping with package development
The package lives as long as contributors are willing to maintain it, so we are thankful you want to put effort into it. To ensure the package has healthy growth, we established ground rules that you **must** apply to your work. 
### Solving issues
Ask in the issue thread if you can solve it.
Package admin will create a branch for your work.
When you solve the issue, run all tests [How should I run tests?]. Create PR **only when all tests pass**. You might need to update the test suite after your corrections; if you need clarification, ask admins what to do in the issue thread.
Run `black` and `flake8` [How should I lint and validate my code?].
Push your PR to the `staging` branch.
Look into your PR's checks. There might be problems with formatting. Solve those and commit changes. When all checks are green, we will be ready to go!
